# Auto-Sentence-complete-
# Auto Sentence Completion System
This project implements an NLP-based auto-sentence completion system using deep learning. It predicts the next word in a sentence based on context, leveraging a Bidirectional LSTM model for sequential data processing and text generation.

# Features
# Deep Learning Model:
Built using a Bidirectional LSTM with an Embedding layer for contextual understanding.
Output layer with softmax activation to predict the next word in the sequence.

# Data Preprocessing:
Used Tokenizer for text vectorization and handled out-of-vocabulary words with a custom <OOV> token.
Created n-gram sequences and padded input sequences to a fixed length for uniform processing.

# Training:
Loss function: Categorical Cross-Entropy.
Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.01.
Achieved efficient sentence continuation through iterative word predictions.

# Interactive Sentence Completion:
Allows users to input a seed sentence and generates up to 10 contextually relevant words.
Stops generation when a terminal word (e.g., '.') is predicted.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas
Model Architecture: Bidirectional LSTM with Embedding

# How It Works
# Data Preparation:
Loads and preprocesses text data from a CSV file.
Tokenizes and sequences text data into n-grams for supervised learning.

# Model Training:
Trains on input sequences to predict the next word in the sequence.
Embeds input data and learns context through the LSTM network.

# Prediction:
Generates text interactively by predicting the next word based on prior words.
Combines predictions to produce a complete sentence.

# Usage
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
Train the model with your dataset or use the provided weights.
Run the script to input a seed sentence and generate completions.
# Future Enhancements
Incorporate Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT for improved contextual predictions.
Expand vocabulary and train on larger datasets for better generalization.

Implement a web interface for user-friendly interaction.
